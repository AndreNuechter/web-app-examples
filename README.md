Some different ways of delivering a wep app. Check out the commit history.

- The first commit shows a simple node.js fullstack app, 
- the second commit turns that app into a PWA and 
- the third converts it into an Electron app using Electron Forge.

Don't forget to `npm install` when moving between commits 1 and 3.
